Hi there! I'm a master's student (incoming PhD starting in September 2024) in computer science under the supervision of Siamak Ravanbakhsh at McGill University and Mila. I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Oxford (2016 - 2020) and previously worked as a research engineer for a biotech startup in London (2020 - 2022).

I am interested in the problem of identifiability and causal abstraction in representation learning, and its connection to probabilistic symmetries.
